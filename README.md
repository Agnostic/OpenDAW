OpenDAW
=======

<p>
OpenDAW is an open source online digital audio workstation (DAW) based on the 
<a href = https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html target = "blank">Web Audio API </a>.

<br>
<br>

So far, various audio clips can be placed on multiple tracks at arbitrary start times according to a 
(currently preprogrammed) .json file. The accuracy of the scheduler is high enough to seamlessly playback looping samples
at the correct times. Samples can be placed at sixteenth note resolution. 

<br>
<br>

As much as possible from the following list of features will be implemented by the project deadline:

<ul>
  <li>Dynamically writable .json file for adding and rearranging samples in the workspace</li>
  <li>Dynamically adding and removing tracks</li>
  <li>Dynamically changing sample length</li>
  <li>Project save/export functionality</li>
  <li>Click and drag samples from directory to workspace</li>
  <li>Track-specific controls such as mute, volume and "single-out" (correct term?)</li>
  <li>Equalization, reverb, compression and other essential effects</li>
  <li>Animated time cursor</li>
  <li>Animated level meter</li>
  <li>User-uploaded samples</li>
  
</ul>

Projects that have helped our progress so far are 
<a href = https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js target="blank"> Wavesurfer.js</a> for generating waveform graphics and
<a href = https://github.com/cwilso/metronome target="blank">Web Audio Metronome</a> for playback scheduling.
